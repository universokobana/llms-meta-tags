# LLMs Meta Tags Standard
> A proposal to standardize HTML meta tags for optimizing content discovery and interpretation by Large Language Models

## Background

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into web browsing, search, and content discovery workflows, websites face a fundamental challenge: how to effectively communicate with both human users and AI systems. Traditional HTML meta tags were designed primarily for search engines and social media platforms, but they lack the specificity and functionality needed for optimal LLM interaction.

Current approaches to LLM optimization often rely on content scraping techniques that are inefficient, imprecise, and resource-intensive. Websites may struggle to provide LLMs with the most relevant information, leading to suboptimal content interpretation and missed opportunities for effective AI-driven discovery.

The emergence of [Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_engine_optimization) as a discipline highlights the need for standardized methods to help websites communicate their structure, purpose, and optimal usage patterns to LLMs. Just as meta tags revolutionized SEO and social media sharing, a new generation of LLM-specific meta tags can bridge the gap between human-readable websites and AI-consumable content.

## Proposal

We propose the **LLMs Meta Tags Standard**, a collection of HTML meta tags specifically designed to enhance LLM understanding and interaction with web content. These tags provide structured metadata that enables more efficient content discovery, improved context understanding, and better integration between websites and AI systems.

The standard introduces some core meta tags that address key aspects of LLM-website interaction:

1. **Redirection to LLM-optimized content** (`llms:website`)
2. **Reading and interpretation instructions** (`llms:instructions`)
3. **AI-focused site descriptions** (`llms:description`)

Unlike traditional meta tags that primarily serve search engines, these tags are designed to be consumed directly by LLMs during inference time, enabling real-time optimization of content presentation and interpretation.

## Meta Tags Specification

### llms:website

**Purpose**: Redirects LLMs to dedicated AI-optimized versions of websites or specific LLM-friendly endpoints.

**Rationale**: As AI integration becomes more prevalent, many organizations are creating specialized versions of their websites designed specifically for LLM consumption. These AI-optimized sites typically feature cleaner markup, structured data, and content specifically curated for machine reading. The `llms:website` tag provides a standardized way to direct LLMs to these optimized resources.

**Use Cases**:
- Companies with both public-facing and AI-specific versions of their documentation
- E-commerce sites offering structured product catalogs for AI agents
- News organizations providing clean, LLM-readable versions of their content
- Educational institutions with AI-optimized course catalogs and resources

**Example**:
```html
<meta name="llms:website" content="https://ai.company.com">
<meta name="llms:website" content="https://docs.company.com/api/llm">
```

**Real-world Example**: The Kobana website (https://www.kobana.com.br) implemented:
```html
<meta name="llms:website" content="https://ai.kobana.com.br">
<meta name="llms:instructions" content="Access the 'llms:website' meta tag to more effectively scrape information about Kobana.">
<meta name="llms:description" content="Kobana is a comprehensive financial automation platform that offers a robust banking API solution to seamlessly integrate ERP and management systems with over 40 banks in Brazil, enabling automation of Pix, Boleto, payments, transfers, as well as financial statements and balances.">
```

This directs LLMs to a dedicated AI interface rather than scraping the human-oriented website, resulting in more accurate information extraction and reduced server load.

### llms:description

**Purpose**: Provides a concise, LLM-optimized description of the website's content, purpose, and key information.

**Rationale**: Traditional meta descriptions are optimized for human readers and search engine snippets, often including marketing language and calls-to-action that may confuse LLMs. The `llms:description` tag provides factual, structured descriptions that help LLMs quickly understand a site's purpose and content scope.

**Use Cases**:
- Clear identification of website purpose and domain
- Specification of available data types and formats
- Indication of update frequency and data freshness
- Description of access requirements or limitations

**Examples**:
```html
<meta name="llms:description" content="Technical documentation for FastAPI web framework. Includes API reference, tutorials, and best practices. Updated daily.">

<meta name="llms:description" content="E-commerce platform specializing in electronics. Product catalog with specifications, reviews, and pricing. Real-time inventory data.">

<meta name="llms:description" content="University course catalog and academic resources. Contains course descriptions, prerequisites, schedules, and faculty information. Updated each semester.">

<meta name="llms:description" content="Financial news and market data. Real-time stock quotes, analysis articles, and economic indicators. Updated continuously during market hours.">
```

### llms:instructions

**Purpose**: Provides specific instructions to LLMs on how to interpret, navigate, and extract information from the website.

**Rationale**: Different websites have unique structures, navigation patterns, and content hierarchies. While LLMs are capable of interpreting web content, explicit instructions can significantly improve accuracy and efficiency. This tag acts as a guide for AI systems, similar to how robots.txt guides web crawlers.

**Use Cases**:
- Complex documentation sites with specific reading orders
- E-commerce platforms with particular product information structures
- News sites with article prioritization guidelines
- Academic websites with research paper hierarchies

**Examples**:
```html
<meta name="llms:instructions" content="Focus on the main content area, ignore sidebar advertisements. Product specifications are in the 'specs' section.">

<meta name="llms:instructions" content="Read documentation in order: Overview, Installation, API Reference. Code examples are in <pre> tags with class 'highlight'.">

<meta name="llms:instructions" content="For academic papers, prioritize abstract, methodology, and conclusions. Supplementary materials are linked in the footer.">
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Basic Implementation

Add the meta tags to the `<head>` section of your HTML documents:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="llms:website" content="https://ai.yoursite.com">
    <meta name="llms:instructions" content="Focus on main content, ignore navigation. Product info is in .product-details class.">
    <meta name="llms:description" content="E-commerce site for outdoor gear. Product catalog with specifications and reviews.">
    
    <!-- Other meta tags -->
    <title>Your Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Best Practices

**For llms:website**:
- Ensure the referenced URL is actively maintained and optimized for LLM consumption
- Use HTTPS and ensure high availability
- Consider implementing API endpoints for structured data access

**For llms:instructions**:
- Keep instructions concise but specific
- Focus on structural guidance rather than content interpretation
- Update instructions when site structure changes significantly


**For llms:description**:
- Use factual, objective language
- Include key data types and update frequencies
- Avoid marketing language and subjective claims
- Keep descriptions under 300 characters for optimal processing

## Existing Standards Compatibility

The LLMs Meta Tags Standard is designed to complement existing web standards and meta tag conventions:

**robots.txt**: While robots.txt controls crawler access, LLMs meta tags provide guidance for content interpretation after access is granted.

**sitemap.xml**: Sitemaps list available pages; LLMs meta tags help optimize how those pages are consumed by AI systems.

**Open Graph and Twitter Cards**: These focus on social media presentation; LLMs meta tags focus on AI consumption and interpretation.

**Schema.org**: Structured data markup provides detailed content semantics; LLMs meta tags provide high-level guidance and optimization hints.

**llms.txt standard**: While llms.txt files remain valuable, these meta tags provide immediate, inline guidance directly in HTML.
